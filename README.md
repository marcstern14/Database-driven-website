# Database-driven-website

This is an e-commerce website for the Brooklyn-based indie rock band Fair Visions. 

The site is purely for academic purposes; it does not currently sell any real items.

The site is coded with PHP and HTML, while integrating a backend database with mySQLi queries, and it runs through C-Panel on a private server at Montclair State University. All code is provided.

A full documentation of the website's functionality, including screenshots of how it looks are in "Full Project Documentation.pdf", which also includes an appendix of all the code.
